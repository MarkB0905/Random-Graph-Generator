# Random-Graph-Generator
A project assigned in an "Algorithms 2" class.

In this assigment I was asked to create a program that received a probability paramater and then created a random graph with 1,000 vertices according to the probability.

After creating the graph the program will check the given graph and return various attributes such as: Diameter, Connectivity, Disconnected edges.

At the end of the assignment we were asked to create 500 graphs for 10 different probabilities and see if each probability upholds various conditioins.
  
This assignment was graded 120/100 for being clean, easy to read, and having an outstanding running time.
